# Databricks E-Commerce ETL and Analysis Project

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering and analysis pipeline using Databricks and PySpark. The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle's E-Commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mervemenekse/ecommerce-dataset/data), consists of 16 columns containing sales, profit, product, and customer data. The goal is to clean, transform, and analyze this dataset to extract meaningful business insights.

The project is designed to showcase advanced data engineering, visualization, and analytical techniques, and will be beneficial for clients in real-world scenarios.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Data Engineering Pipeline**
- **Raw Layer**: Ingest raw data into Databricks.
- **Clean Layer**: Handle missing values, standardize formats, and derive new columns.
- **Aggregated Layer**: Summarize data for business insights and dashboards.
- **Analytical Layer**: Enrich the data for advanced analytics like customer segmentation and predictive modeling.

### **2. Advanced Use Cases**
- Customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
- Product performance analysis to identify top-selling and most profitable products.
- Sales trends over time to identify seasonality and patterns.

### **3. Visualizations in Databricks Notebook**
- Interactive dashboards with sales and profit trends.
- Heatmaps for regional sales distribution.
- Scatter plots for customer segmentation and behavioral insights.

### **4. Scalable Storage and Access**
- Store the transformed and enriched data in Delta Lake for efficient querying.

### **5. Optional Advanced Features**
- Predictive modeling for sales forecasting and churn prediction.
- Real-time data streaming to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Integration with external data sources for added context.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Databricks**: For running scalable ETL and analytics pipelines.
- **PySpark**: For data processing and transformations.
- **Delta Lake**: For storing and managing transformed data.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization (optional, where Databricks UI is not sufficient).
